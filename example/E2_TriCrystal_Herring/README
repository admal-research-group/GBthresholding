[1,2,3] system size: nx, ny, nz.

    For 2D simulation, simply substitute nz=1.

[4] epsilon value (Parameter of KWC model)


It is suggest to run the executable as following command lines

(Example)

./main 1024 1024 1 0.045

The orientaition angle of each crystal is 0, pi/6 and pi/3.

With a sufficiently small value of \epsilon,
the diffused KWD grain boundary energy also should acheive (90 degree, 135 degree, 135 degree)

There are some points one should be awared of.

When testing the Herring angle condition, the following \epsilon condtion is conflicting

1) For a straight Grain boundary, you need to increase epsilon to maintain
thresholding algorithm to keep going.

2) To achieve the sharp interface property (Herring condition),
epsilon sholud be sufficiently small.

These conflicting condition can be compromised in a more refined grid system,
which may increase the cost of this simulation significantly.
