README:

In this code, we run KWC bicrystal simulation
When misorientation between two crystal is pi/6, 
it should speak out KWC energy approximatedly 0.62.

Makefile will compile the main.cpp

main.cpp

List of inputs

[1,2,3] system size: nx, ny, nz.

    For 2D simulation, simply substitute nz=1.

[4] epsilon value (Parameter of KWC model)


It is suggest to run the executable as following command lines

(Example)

./main 1024 1024 1 0.01 

There are some points one should be awared of.

1) Ideally, Grain Boundary Energy should not dependent on the choice of epsilon.
The change in $epsilon$ maintains the total energy,
but affects the width of grain boundary region
(diffuseing the interface).

2) In real simulation, one may wish to run with small $epsilon$,
which is close to a sharp interface. However, when $epsilon$ is too small,
the gradient estimator (when computing numerically computing total energy of system),
has larger error. A more refined  grid space (>2048x2048) will
capture this and one can see correct energy.
